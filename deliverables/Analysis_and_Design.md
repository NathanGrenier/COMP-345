# TODO: REMOVE THIS. INSTRUCTIONS FROM PROF
Along with your submitted code, you have to explain your analysis and 
design. Briefly explain the game rules involved in the creation of your assignment, citing 
external sources for specific game rules. Briefly describe the design you adopted as a solution. 
The design description can be backed-up, for example, by doxygen-generated documentation, 
regular code comments, or a simple diagram. The focus of this course being the coding aspect 
of software development, you are discouraged to submit extensive documentation, and if you 
do, you will not receive additional marks for doing so.
